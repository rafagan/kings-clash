/// Steers a vehicle to be repulsed by stationary obstacles
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// For every obstacle detected, this will:
/// 1) Add up a repulsion vector that is the distance between the vehicle 
/// and the obstacle, divided by the squared magnitude of the distance 
/// between the obstacle and the vehicle's future intended position. This is
/// done because the further an obstacle is from our desired position, the
/// least we care about it (which could have side effects when dealing with
/// very large obstacles which we don't happen to intersect, need to review).
/// 2) If we would intersect this obstacle on our current path, then we 
/// multiply this repulsion vector by a factor of the number of detected
/// (since the others might just be to the side and we want to give it
/// higher weight).
/// 3) Divide the total by the number of obstacles.
/// The final correction vector is the old desired velocity reflected 
/// along the calculated avoidance vector.
