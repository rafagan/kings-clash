Steering behaviors for Unity, initially based on OpenSteer. Please read 
License.txt before using in your projects.

Starting on 2.5, UnitySteer depends on TickedPriorityQueue. You should
download these two files from Mike Garforth's repository, and add them to 
your project:

https://github.com/Garufortho/TickedPriorityQueue/downloads

Perusing the latest changelog is strongly recommended.

If you're looking for a specific version, you can look at the project tags:

https://github.com/ricardojmendez/UnitySteer/tree/v2.2
https://github.com/ricardojmendez/UnitySteer/tree/v2.1

Assume that any code not on master branch is most definitely not ready for 
prime time.   That goes double for code on the experimental branch, where 
approaches are likely to change from one day to another.
